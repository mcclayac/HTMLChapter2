Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, vice chair of the Jan. 6 select committee, outlined why she believes former President Trump's White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows is in contempt of Congress.

"He has not claimed and doesn't have any privilege basis to refuse to answer our questions about these texts and about these topics," she said while speaking at a Rule Committee hearing this morning. The Rules Committee is taking up the contempt item, with a full vote in the House expected later today.

Last night, the Jan. 6 panel unveiled a series of text messages from lawmakers and Fox News hosts imploring Meadows to stop the Capitol riot.
